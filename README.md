# Achaba Analytics – Business Website Concept

Achaba Analytics is a fully responsive, accessibility-focused business website built with modern frontend best practices.  

This project demonstrates structured UI architecture, performance-conscious design, and clean JavaScript state management using only core web technologies.

This is a production-style frontend implementation for a conceptual data analytics consultancy.  

The goal was to build a realistic, scalable business website while emphasizing:

- Clean semantic HTML
- Maintainable CSS architecture
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization
- Structured JavaScript interaction


### Responsive Architecture
- Mobile-first layout
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Fluid typography using `clamp()`
- Sticky navigation
- Responsive navigation drawer

### Accessibility Implementation
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Skip-to-content link
